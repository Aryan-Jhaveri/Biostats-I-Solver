# Biostats-HLSC2P07-I-Solver

I fell in love with Coding and R studio as i was preparing for my finals for the HLSC2P07. 

The Terms of the course were that we were allowed to use any of Our R files to aide in solving the final exam.

So like one does, i focused all my energy into coding the perfect cheat sheet R file that would help solve any sort of statistical questions in the textbook.

I ended up making custom made functions FOR EVERY QUESTION in my course that simply rely on manual input, and give the complete output where necessay.

For instance, I could conduct Two Way anova and not have to memorise the statistical statements, and inferences that come with the calculations. The function could do all my calculation, along with printing of statistical statements and results where necessary.

To those currently taking this course, and stumbling upon this GitHub, the .Rmd is a goldmine of a resource and i have done my best to document what certain codes mean. But this file is simply not a substitute for your statistical understanding, but merely a tool to make calculations really, really easy.
